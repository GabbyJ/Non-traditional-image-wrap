# Non Traditional Image Wrap: Black Panther Tribute

I learned about a css method called shape-outside. Along with shape-threshold and shape-margin. It allows you to text wrap an image based off it's actual outline instead of it's rectangualr or circle outer image outline. I created a sample to try for myself and made it a Black Panther Tribute in honor of Chadwick Boseman's recent unexpected death from cancer.

I wrote a <a href="https://gabbysadventure.com/how-to-easily-wrap-text-around-image-outline/" target="_blank">detailed blog article</a> about it here. You can play with it using <a href="https://codepen.io/gabbyj/pen/MWyvgpg" target="_blank">my CodePen</a> here.
